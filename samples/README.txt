This directory contains a smattering of uPerm programs I used at various times during testing.
uPerm source files end with '.p'.

~/samples
   /LRM
   /dimino
   /test
   /misc

~/dimino	Programs under ~/dimino constitute a useful uPerm program to enumerate every element
		in a group generated by a certain list of elements.

~/LRM		Programs under ~/LRM provide implementations of samples from the LRM, are named
		according to the section in which they appear.

~/test		Various tests of uPerm's syntax and semantics.

~/misc		Meh.
